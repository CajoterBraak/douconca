\title{Species-level Permutation Test in Double Constrained Correspondence Analysis (dc-CA)}
\usage{
anova_species(object, permutations = 999, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object from \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}}.}

\item{permutations}{a list of control values for the permutations as
returned by the function \code{\link[permute]{how}}, or
the number of permutations required (default 999) or
a permutation matrix where each row gives the permuted indices.}

\item{by}{character \code{"axis"} which sets the test statistic to the
first eigenvalue of the dc-CA model.
Default: \code{NULL} which set the test statistic to the inertia named \code{constraintsTE}
in the inertia element of \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}}). This is
the environmentally constrained inertia explained by the traits (without trait covariates).
(which is equal to the trait-constrained inertia
explained by the environmental predictors (without covariates).)
The default is quicker computationally as it avoid computation of an svd of permuted data sets.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements with names \code{table} and \code{eig}.
 The \code{table} is as from \code{\link[vegan]{anova.cca}} and \code{eig} gives the dc-CA eigenvalues,
 This output can be used for scripting forward selection of traits,
 similar to the forward selection of environmental
 variables in the demo \code{dune_select.r}.
}
\description{
\code{anova_species} performs a species-level permutation test of dc-CA.
The test uses residual predictor permutation (ter Braak 2022), which is robust
against differences in species total abundance in the \code{response} in \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}} (ter Braak & te Beest, 2022)
The arguments of the function are similar to those of \code{\link[vegan]{anova.cca}},
but more restrictive.
}
\details{
In \code{\link{anova_species}}, the first step extracts the species-niche centroids (SNC)
with respect to all dc-CA ordination axes
from an existing dc-CA analysis. These SNCs (more precisely, a rotated version thereof)
could have been obtained from a \code{\link[vegan]{cca}}
of the abundance data with the environmental variables as predictors, but this is computationally slower,
of course, than just extracting the unconstrained species scores from an existing dc-CA. The second step,
applies a weighted redundancy analysis of these SNCs with the traits as predictors. The second step is thus
a species-level analysis, but the final results (eigenvalues/ordination axes) are identical to those of the
analyses steps in \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}}.The second step uses
published R-code for weighted redundancy analysis, which includes statistical significance
tests using residual predictor permutation (ter Braak, 2022).
