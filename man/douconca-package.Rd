\title{The package douconca performs double constrained correspondence 
analysis for trait-environment analysis in ecology}
\description{
Double constrained correspondence analysis (dc-CA) for analyzing 
(multi-)trait (multi-)environment ecological data using library \code{vegan}
and native R code. It has a \code{formula} interface which allows to assess, 
for example, the importance of trait interactions in shaping ecological 
communities. The function\code{dc_CA} has an option to divide the abundance 
data of a site by the site total, giving equal site weights. This division 
has the advantage that the multivariate analysis corresponds with an 
unweighted (multi-trait) community-level analysis, instead of being weighted.

Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018) is used. This 
algorithm combines and extends community- (sample-) and species-level 
analyses, \emph{i.e.} (1) the usual community weighted means (CWM) 
regression analysis and (2) the species-level analysis of species-niche 
centroids (SNC) regression analysis. The SNC is the center of the realized 
niche of the species along an environmental variable or, in the case of 
dc-CA, an environmental gradient, \emph{i.e.} the dc-CA ordination axis.
Computationally, dc-CA can be carried out by a single singular value 
decomposition (ter Braak et al. 2018), but it is here computed in two steps.

The first step of the algorithm uses canonical correspondence analysis by 
\code{\link[vegan]{cca}}. The second step uses weighted redundancy analysis 
by \code{\link{wrda}}, but redundancy analysis by \code{\link[vegan]{rda}}, 
if the site weights are equal.

In detail, the first step uses \code{\link[vegan]{cca}} to regress the 
(transposed) abundance data on to the traits and the second step uses
either \code{\link[vegan]{rda}} or \code{\link{wrda}} to regress the CWMs 
of the orthonormalized traits, obtained from the first step, on to the 
environmental predictors. The second step is thus a community-level analysis.

If \code{divide.by.site.totals = FALSE}, the second step uses 
\code{\link{wrda}} and performs a weighted redundancy analyis of the CWMs 
on to the environmental variables.

Division of the abundance data by the site totals has the advantage that 
the resulting analysis (without dimension reduction, \emph{i.e.} retaining 
all dc-CA axes) corresponds with a series of unweighted community-level 
analyses, instead of the analyses being weighted.

Warning: The \code{dcCA} package was built from \code{vegan} version 2.6-4 
and uses some of the internal structure of the \code{vegan} 
\code{\link[vegan]{cca.object}} in the not-exported functions 
\code{f_inertia} and \code{get_QR} in the source code file 
\code{functions_using_cca_object_internals.r}.

The main user-functions are \code{\link{dc_CA}}, \code{\link{plot_dcCA}}, 
\code{\link{scores.dcca}}, \code{\link{print.dcca}} and 
\code{\link{anova.dcca}}.
