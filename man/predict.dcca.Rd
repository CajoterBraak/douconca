\usage{
\method{predict}{dcca}(
  object,
  ...,
  type = c("envFromTraits", "traitsFromEnv", "response", "SNC", "CWM", "lc", "lc_traits"),
  rank = "full",
  newdata = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  scaling = "symmetric"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{return value of \code{\link{dc_CA}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to the function (currently ignored).}

\item{type}{type of prediction, \code{c("envFromTraits", "traitsFromEnv",
"response", "lc", "lc_traits")} 
for environmental values, values of traits, 
response (expected abundance) and constrained scores for sites and species. 
\code{"SNC"} is equivalent with \code{c("envFromTraits")}.
\code{"CWM"} is equivalent with \code{c("traitsFromEnv")}.}

\item{rank}{rank (number of axes to use). Default "full" for all axes 
(no rank-reduction).}

\item{newdata}{Data in which to look for variables with which to predict.
For \code{type = "envFromTraits" or "traitsFromEnv"} or 
 \code{type = "lc_traits" or "lc"},
\code{newdata} is a data frame of trait and environmental values, respectively, 
which are used for the prediction or the calculation of scores. 
If omitted, fitted values are generated (use \code{\link{fitted.dcca}} instead).
For \code{type = "response"}, newdata is a list of two data frames with 
trait and environmental values in this order, \emph{e.g.} 
\code{list(traits = dataTraits, env = dataEnv)}.}

\item{weights}{list of weights of species and of sites in \code{newdata} when
\code{type = "response"}, else ignored (default NULL
yielding equal species and site weights, both summing to 1). 
Example: weights = list(species = c(100,1,1), sites = c(1,1,1,1)), in that
order, with traits of three new species in newdata[[1]] and 
environmental values (and levels of factors) of four new sites in newdata[[2]]. 
Species weights are scaled to a sum of one.}

\item{scaling}{numeric (1,2 or 3) or character \code{"sites", "species" or
"symmetric"}. Default: "symmetric". Either site- (1) or species- (2) related
scores are scaled by eigenvalues, and the other set of scores have
unit weighted mean square or with 3 both are scaled symmetrically 
to weighted mean squares equal to the square root of eigenvalues. Negative 
values are treated as the corresponding positive ones by \code{abs(scaling)}.}
}
\value{
a matrix with the predictions. The exact content of the matrix 
depends on the \code{type} of predictions that are being made.
}
\description{
Prediction of traits from environment, environment from traits and response 
from trait and environment data.
}
\details{
Variables that are in the model but not in \code{newdata} are set to their 
weighted means in the training data. Predictions are thus at the (weighted)
mean of the quantitative variables not included. Predictions with 
not-included factors are at the reference level (the first level of the factor).

For \code{type = "response"}, many of the 
predicted values may be negative, indicating expected absences (0) or small
expected response values.

With \code{type = "traitsFromEnv"} and \code{newdata = NULL}, predict gives the 
fitted mean traits, \emph{i.e.} the fitted community weighted means.
With \code{type = "envFromTraits"} and \code{newdata = NULL}, predict gives the 
fitted mean environment, \emph{i.e.} the fitted species niche centroids
(see \code{\link{fitted.dcca}}). See \code{fitted.dcca}.
