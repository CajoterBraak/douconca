\title{Utility function: community-level permutation test in Double 
Constrained Correspondence Analysis (dc-CA)}
\usage{
anova_sites(object, permutations = 999, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object from \code{\link{dc_CA}}.}

\item{permutations}{a list of control values for the permutations as 
returned by the function \code{\link[permute]{how}}, or the number of 
permutations required (default 999), or a permutation matrix where each 
row gives the permuted indices.}

\item{by}{character \code{"axis"} which sets the test statistic to the 
first eigenvalue of the dc-CA model. Default: \code{NULL} which sets the 
test statistic to the inertia (sum of all double constrained eigenvalues; 
named  \code{constraintsTE} in the inertia element of \code{\link{dc_CA}}). 
This is the trait constrained inertia explained by the environmental 
predictors (without covariates), which is equal to the 
environmentally-constrained inertia explained by the traits (without trait 
covariates). The default is quicker computationally as it avoids
computation of an svd of permuted data sets.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements with names \code{table} and \code{eigenvalues}.
The \code{table} is as from \code{\link[vegan]{anova.cca}} and 
\code{eigenvalues} gives the dc-CA eigenvalues.
}
\description{
\code{anova_sites} performs the community-level permutation test of dc-CA 
when site weights vary.
The test uses residual predictor permutation (ter Braak 2022), which is 
robust against differences in site total abundance in the \code{response} 
in \code{\link{dc_CA}} (ter Braak & te Beest, 2022).
The arguments of the function are similar to those of 
\code{\link[vegan]{anova.cca}}, but more restricted. With equal site-totals 
as in \code{\link{dc_CA}}, \code{anova(object$RDAonEnv)} is much faster.
}
\details{
The algorithm is analogous to that of \code{\link{anova.wrda}}. The function
is used in \code{\link{anova.dcca}}.

# anova_species can be used for manual forward selection of
# trait variables, as done for environmental variables in the demo 
# dune_FS_dcCA.r, based on the first eigenvalue and its significance
# and adding the first axis of the constrained species scores from mod to 
# the Condition of a new mod.
