Description: Double constrained correspondence analysis (dc-CA) analyzes 
   (multi-)trait (multi-)environment ecological data by using library vegan and 
   native R code. Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018)
   is used. This algorithm combines and extends community- (sample-) and 
   species-level analyses, i.e. the usual community weighted means (CWM)-based
   regression analysis and the species-level analysis of species-niche centroids
   (SNC)-based regression analysis. The two steps use canonical correspondence
   analysis to regress the abundance data on to the traits and (weighted)
   redundancy analysis to regress the CWM of the orthonormalized traits on to 
   the environmental predictors. The function dc_CA has an option to divide the
   abundance data of a site by the site total, giving equal site weights. This
   division has the advantage that the multivariate analysis corresponds with
   an unweighted (multi-trait) community-level analysis, instead of being 
   weighted. The first step of the algorithm uses vegan::cca. The second step 
   uses douconca::wrda but vegan::rda if the site weights are equal. This 
   version has a predict function. For details see ter Braak et al. 2018
